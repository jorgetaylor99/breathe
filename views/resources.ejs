                Asthma is a chronic respiratory condition that causes the
                airways in the lungs to become inflamed, narrow, and produce
                extra mucus. This can make breathing difficult, lead to
                coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath. It is important to
                understand the triggers, symptoms, and treatments to manage the
                condition effectively. Common Asthma Triggers: Identifying and
                avoiding triggers is crucial for people living with asthma.
                Common triggers include: Allergens: Pollen, dust mites, mold
                spores, and pet dander Respiratory infections: Cold, flu, and
                bronchitis Exercise: Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB)
                Environmental factors: Smoke, pollution, and changes in weather
                Emotional factors: Stress and strong emotions Lifestyle Changes:
                Making certain lifestyle changes can help in managing asthma
                symptoms and reducing the risk of asthma attacks. These include:
                Avoiding smoking and second-hand smoke Maintaining a healthy
                weight Managing stress through relaxation techniques Exercising
                regularly, but with caution and under medical supervision Using
                air purifiers to reduce allergens in the home Asthma Action
                Plan: Work with your healthcare provider to develop a
                personalized asthma action plan. This plan should include
                information on your medications, how to identify and avoid
                triggers, and what to do in case of an asthma attack.

                Medications and Treatment: Asthma medications are divided into
                two main categories: Long-term control medications: Inhaled
                corticosteroids, long-acting beta-agonists, and leukotriene
                modifiers Quick-relief medications: Short-acting beta-agonists
                and anticholinergics What to Do in the Event of an Asthma
                Attack: If you or someone you know experiences an asthma attack,
                follow these steps: Stay calm and sit upright to facilitate
                breathing Use your quick-relief inhaler (usually a short-acting
                beta-agonist) as prescribed by your doctor Wait for 5-10 minutes
                to see if your symptoms improve If there's no improvement or if
